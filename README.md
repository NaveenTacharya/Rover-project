This is about the rover project
    HYDROGEN SULPHIDE SENSOR AND METHANE SENSOR :

     1.	HYDROGEN SULPHIDE SENSOR :


      •	Hydrogen sulphide is obtained during drilling and production of crude oil and natural gas.
      •	It mainly represents the Microbial Breakdown of organic matter.

     A)	PROPERTIES OF HYDROGEN SULFIDE :

      •	Present in the absence of oxygen.

      •	Colourless.

      •	Highly flammable.

      •	Corrosive.


       By considering all this properties MQ 136 is the best  HYDROGEN SULPHIDE sensor to use in the rover.

      •	Sensitive material of MQ136 gas sensor is SnO2, which with lower conductivity in clean air.
      •	When the target Hydrogen-sulphide gas exist, the sensor’s conductivity is higher along with the Hydrogen-sulphide concentration rising .

     2.	METHANE SENSOR :

      •	Methane is produced by the breakdown or decay of organic material and can be introduced into the atmosphere by either natural processes.
      •	Methane represents the anaerobic bacterial decomposition of matter.

     A)	PROPERTIES OF METHANE :
      •	Colourless.
      •	Odourless.
      •	Non toxic. 


       	MQ-2 is a best sensor for the detection of methane.
